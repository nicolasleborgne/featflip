Routes should be named as: `{app_name}_{entity_path}_{action}`

- app_name: featflip
- entity_path: things such as "organization", "organization_team" or "organization_project"
- action:
    - can be a domain action
    - On crud based action :
        - list
        - create
        - update
        - delete
        - show
